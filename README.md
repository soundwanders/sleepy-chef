##### Time-Saving Treats: 30 Minute Recipes for Busy Chefs

### https://sleepychef.vercel.app/

- Sleepy Chef lets you search for recipes  based on type, name, or ingredients.
- Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB + deployed with Vercel.
- useSWR provides a convenient way to handle caching and revalidation. Plus some extra spicy syntax for data fetching.
- Next's useRouter hook sends and receives user's query & query parameters, which we use to filter and sort our recipes with our Next.js API Handler function.
- Our API responds to user queries by using key-value pairs to return all matching recipes as Objects, delivering recipe results.
- getStaticPaths and getStaticProps generate our static pages at build time, which eliminates the need for on-demand server-side rendering and greatly reduces the load placed on the servers.
- Recipe cards double as Next.js Link components, navigating to individual recipe pages built with SSR methods.
- React Context used to avoid prop drilling and improve scalability by creating a context to share unaltered recipe data between components if needed.
- Experimenting with the use of [Glyphhanger](https://github.com/soundwanders/sleepy-chef/blob/main/glyphhanger-experiment.md) to optimize webfont loading by subsetting font files to only include the characters used in Sleepy Chef.
