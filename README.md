# üë©‚Äçüç≥ Sleepy Chef
##### Got a mixed bag of leftover ingredients and an empty belly? We got you!

### https://sleepychef.vercel.app/

- Sleepy Chef allows users to search for recipes based on type, name, or ingredients.
- Built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS, deployed with Vercel.
- Next's useRouter hook helps send and receive the user's query + query parameters, necessary to filter/sort the recipe API data.
- Dynamically generated recipe pages with Promises for async API calls using two different endpoints.
- React Context allows us to share the recipe data between components, adds flexibility and scalability.
- [Fuzzy-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuzzy-search) used to flexibly match a string with partial input to 'widen the net' while fetching search results.
