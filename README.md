##### Time-Saving Treats: 30 Minute Recipes for Busy Chefs

### https://sleepychef.vercel.app/

- Sleepy Chef lets you search for recipes based on type, name, or ingredients.
- A search-engine type UI for simple, straightforward recipes with no nonsense.
- Built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS, deployed with Vercel.
- useSWR provides a convenient way to handle caching, revalidation, and focus tracking. Plus some extra spicy syntax for data fetching.
- Next's useRouter hook sends and receives the user's query & query parameters, which we use to filter and sort the recipe API data.
- API responds to user-submitted queries, filtering appropriate response by using key-value pairs to return all matching recipes as Objects.
- getStaticPaths and getStaticProps generate our static Recipe pages at build time, which eliminates the need for on-demand server-side rendering and greatly reduces the load placed on the servers.
- Recipe cards double as Next.js Link components, navigating to individual recipe pages built with SSR methods.
- React Context used to avoid prop drilling and improve scalability by creating a context to share unaltered recipe data between components.
- Experimenting with the use of [Glyphhanger](https://github.com/soundwanders/sleepy-chef/blob/main/glyphhanger-experiment.md) to optimize webfont loading by subsetting font files to only include the characters used in Sleepy Chef.
