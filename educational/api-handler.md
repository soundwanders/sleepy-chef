This `recipes.js` file is an API handler for a Next.js application. 

The file first imports the recipes database from the `@data/recipeDb` file, which contains an array of recipe objects. The file then defines a search function, which filters the recipes database based on a given paramType and paramValue. The search function uses a switch statement to determine which property of the recipe object to compare with the paramValue depending on the paramType.

Next, the file defines a priorityMap object, which contains the properties id, type, name, and ingredient. The priorityMap object maps each query parameter to a numerical priority value, which is used to prioritize the search based on the query parameters.

The handler function is the main focus of the file, which is exported and executed when an HTTP request is made to the `/api/recipes` endpoint. The handler function takes in two arguments, req and res, which represent the incoming request and the server's response, respectively. It starts by destructuring the query object from the incoming req object, which contains the query parameters from the request. The type, ingredient, name, and id parameters are then destructured from the query object.

The function then creates an array of query parameters, queryParams, which consists of objects that contain the param value, the type, and the priority value. This array is then sorted based on the priority value, with the highest priority parameters appearing first.

The queryParams array is then reduced to an array of filtered recipes using the reduce method. The searchFunction is called on each query parameter to filter the recipes database, and the results are concatenated to the recipes array in each iteration of the reduce method.

Finally, the function checks if any recipes were found by checking the length of the filteredRecipes array. If there are no matching recipes, the function returns a response with a status code of 400 and a JSON object containing an error message. If there are matching recipes, the function returns a response with a status code of 200 and a JSON object containing the filtered recipes.

Overall, the pages/api/recipes.js file serves as a crucial component of the recipe search feature, handling incoming requests and returning relevant information based on the parameters included in the query string.
