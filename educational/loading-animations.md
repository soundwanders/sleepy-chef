The `Animations` component is a page transition animation, created using the Framer Motion library, which shows an egg that drops and bounces, then reveals the yolk inside.

`Animations` uses the useMotionValue and useTransform hooks from Framer Motion to control the egg's position and opacity.

The component defines two states: showYolk, which determines whether the yolk should be shown, and y, which represents the vertical position of the egg.

The MotionValue called eggOpacity is derived from the value of the y MotionValue (the y position of the Egg). 

The useTransform function maps the range of y from [0, 100, 120, 130, 140] to [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]. This means that as the y position of the egg changes during the animation, the eggOpacity will transition from 1 to 0 to 1, creating a fade-out and fade-in effect for the egg.

When y is between 100 and 120, eggOpacity will be 1, which means the egg will be fully visible. When y is less than 100 or greater than 120, eggOpacity will be 0, which means the egg will be invisible.

The onAnimationComplete function is called when the animation is finished, and it sets the showYolk state to true after a 100 millisecond delay that is assigned using setTimeout.

The motion.div related to the Egg image defines an animated div that moves from its initial position, specified by style={{ y }}, to a new position, specified by animate={{ y: 200 }}. The y value is controlled by the useMotionValue(0) hook and represents the vertical position of the motion.div.

The transition prop defines the animation transition that occurs when the motion.div moves from its initial position to the new position. In this case, the transition is set to have a duration of 1 second and an ease-out easing function. The times and keyframes arrays define a multi-step animation where the motion.div moves up and down a few times before settling into its final position, simulating the egg falling, then bouncing and settling into its final resting place before it disappears and the yolk image appears.

The onAnimationComplete prop specifies a callback function that gets called when the animation is complete. In this case, it sets the showYolk state to true after a delay of 100 milliseconds using the setTimeout function, which, you guessed it, shows the yolk image. Nice!

The motion.img elements represent both the egg and yolk images, and they use the opacity and display CSS properties to control their visibility. When the animation is finished, the egg disappears and the yolk appears in its place.

The second animation is the same exact egg dropping and bouncing animation, but the yolk does not appear. This secondary animation is used in place of a progress bar or similar loading device on the search results page. Since UseSWR loads data at blazing fast speeds, the search results loading animation will not always be displayed.

Overall, it is a relatively simple page transition animation which I hope serves as a useful example for somebody interested in working with the framer-motion library.
