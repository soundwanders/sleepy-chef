## __Framer Motion__

We used the Framer Motion library to create an animation of an egg breaking and revealing a yolk. Here's what's happening:

__________________

- useMotionValue(0) creates a motion value that we'll use to animate the position of the egg. y is the current value of that motion value.
- useState(false) creates a state variable that will be used to determine when to show the yolk. showYolk is the current value of that state variable.
- useTransform(y, [0, 100, 120, 130, 140], [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]) creates a transform that maps the y value to an opacity value for the egg. 
- When y is between 0 and 100, the opacity is 1 (fully visible). When y is between 120 and 130, the opacity drops to 0 (fully transparent). 
- Then it goes back up to 1 between 130 and 140 before disappearing again.
- onAnimationComplete is a function that will be called when the animation is finished. It sets showYolk to true after a short delay.
- The motion.div component wraps everything and is used to animate the position of the egg. The animate prop specifies the final position of the egg (y=200), 
- the transition prop specifies the animation parameters (duration, easing, etc.), and the style prop applies the y value to the position of the egg.
- There are two motion.img components inside the motion.div component. The first one displays the egg and uses the opacity value from eggOpacity.
- The display property is set to "none" when showYolk is true so that it disappears when the yolk appears. 
- The second motion.img component displays the yolk and is only shown when showYolk is true.

useTransform is a function from the Framer Motion library that allows you to map a value from one range to another range. In this case, y is the current position of the egg during its animation, and it is being mapped to a range of opacity values.

In our use-case, the input range is y, which is the vertical position of the falling egg. The output range is an array of opacity values [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which means that the opacity of the egg will always be 1 (100% opacity) while it is falling and bouncing, and will only disappear once the yolk's state is set to visible.

The keyframes property is used to define a series of values that the animated property will take during the animation. In this case, the animated property is y, which controls the vertical position of the motion div.

The keyframes property defines an array of values that the y property should take at specific points in time. In this particular example, the keyframes array has five values: 0, -300, 0, -100, 0.

- At 0 (the beginning of the animation) the y property is set to 0, which means .
- At time 0.2 (20% into the animation), the y property is set to -300. This means that the motion div has been translated 300 pixels upwards from its original position.
- At time 0.5 (50% into the animation), the y property is set to 0 again. This means that the motion div has returned to its original position.
- At time 0.8 (80% into the animation), the y property is set to -100. This means that the motion div has been translated 100 pixels upwards from its original position.
- At time 1 (the end of the animation), the y property is set to 0 again, which means the motion div has returned to its original position.

The entire sequence creates a bounce effect as the egg falls and bounces, then finally the yolk appears.
