## __API & Next.js API Handler Function__

Our projecy contains a `recipes.js` file powers our Sleepy Chef API, as well as the handler function that controls how our application responds to with user search queries.

First thing's first, we have to import the recipes database from the `@data/recipeDb` file, which contains our array of recipe objects. The file then defines the API search function, which filters the recipes database based on a given parameter type and value. The search function uses a switch statement to determine which property of the recipe object to compare with the paramValue depending on the paramType.

Next, we define our priorityMap object, which contains the properties id, type, name, and ingredient. PriorityMap, believe it or not, maps each query parameter to a numerical priority value, which is used to prioritize the search based on the query parameters fed to it. Yum.

The API handler function is the star of the show, which is exported and executed whenever an HTTP request is made to our `/api/recipes` endpoint. The handler function takes in two arguments, req and res, which represent the incoming request and the server's response, respectively. 

It starts by destructuring the query object from the incoming req object, which contains the query parameters from the request. The type, ingredient, name, and id parameters are then destructured from the query object.

The function then creates an array of query parameters, `queryParams`, which consists of objects that contain the param value, the type, and the priority value. This array is then sorted based on the priority value, with the highest priority parameters appearing first.

Our old friend `queryParams` is then reduced to an array of filtered recipes using the `reduce` method. The search function is called on each query parameter to filter the recipes database, and the results are concatenated to the recipes array in each iteration of the reduce method.

Finally, the function checks if any recipes were found by checking the length of the filteredRecipes array. If there are no matching recipes, the function returns a response with a status code of 400 and a JSON object containing an error message. If there are matching recipes, the function returns a response with a status code of 200, and a JSON object containing the filtered recipes.

Overall, the pages/api/recipes.js file serves as a crucial component of the recipe search feature, handling incoming requests and returning relevant information based on the parameters included in the query string. So in other words, it's the brains behind this operation. I just work here. Thanks for reading.
